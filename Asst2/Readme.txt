--->	POPL.java file contains the code for both part one and part two.
--->	Place the input to be given in any file and update the name of the file while creating the POPL object in part.java
--->	Then run the code to get the output of part-1.
--->	The outputs of the inputs have been placed as images.

--->	To get output of part-2 : in the main method simply call the "checkEq " method on the POPL object ; 
it asks for 2 input strings, which are the variables whose equivalence is to be checked.

--->	The explanation of the code has been given as comments within the code.


THE RULES USED FOR PART - 2:

--->	Structural Equivalence for 'functions' and 'pointer types' and 'array'.
--->	Name Equivalence is used for pre-defined datatypes.
--->	Internal Name Equivalence is not used anywhere.
